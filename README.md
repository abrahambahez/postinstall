# Post-Install personal scripts

This repository contains scripts to setup a new Linux/MacOs installation, based on my Linux distros

## Install scripts

Scripts directory can be symlinked locally to `.local/bin`.

Use the `link-scripts.sh` script to do it. Use `unlink-scripts.sh` to remove the symlinks.
